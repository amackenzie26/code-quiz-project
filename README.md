Pseudocode for code quiz project 

What: I am creating a quiz game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript
with a responsive user interface. It needs a start button, a timer, buttons 
for answers, and fill blanks for answers. It also needs a time limit that 
reaches 0 or all questions answered. It also needs the game to end and 
a option to save users initials and score.

How:

HTML: My html will need a header at the top, div(box) for the questions, 
miltiple choice buttons for those questions. It will need a div within the header for the timer.

CSS: I will need to style the header, the header fonts, the timer, and the div with my quiz questions in it, as well as the fonts and buttons within the questions in that div. 

JS: Timer - I will need to make a function to start the timer by clicking a button and I will need algorithms to decrimate the time on the timer. It will need a starting time and will need to give a score when time is 0. 
Questions box - Questions will need a function to cycle through. It needs to compare users answers (button clicks) to the correct answer and record either a true or false answer. It will keep or subtract time and that answer will add or subtract from their total score. It will make the previous question disappear and then next question appear. 
Final Score: If the timer reaches zero or all questions are answer, a new box or screen with a form will appear asking in on section for the users initial, and displaying their score in the section below. It will have a save button which will need to record both the intials entered and the score recorded.
